# Blueprint
Blueprint is the game which I made first. I learned how to employ physics on programming; I needed to build 2D physics engine for it. I published this game on Steam, which is a video game digital distribution platform.

How to use it
-------------
Build the code or just run Blueprint\blueprint\blueprint.exe

# Blueprint
Blueprint is the game which I made first. I learned how to employ physics on programming; I made 2D physics engine myself. Of course, I can use other physics engine library like 2D box. However, I wanted to make with myself. I published this game on Steam, which is a video game digital distribution platform.

How to use it

Build the code or just run blueprint\blueprint.exe
